          <p>
            The Government Arts College (Autonomous), Coimbatore was established
            in the year 1852 by the British Government. This College is one of
            the best Government Institutions in Tamilnadu. Top beaurocrats,
            administrators, defence personnel and high profile politicians are
            alumni of this institution. It was conferred autonomous status in
            the year 1987.
          </p>

          <p>
            In 2012, the college was re-accredited with ‚ÄòA‚Äô Grade by NAAC.
            Admissions to the college is coveted by students due to the
            exceptional guidance offered by highly qualified teaching faculty.
            The ultimate aim of education is to make a person knowledgeable and
            well informed and offer him / her life skills so that one can earn
            one‚Äôs livelihood. In today‚Äôs world it would certainly be myopic to
            look at any educational programme purely from the job placement
            point of view. In the present scenario of economic turbulence an
            educational programme / College that would ensure a long term
            benefit such as sustainability rather than a short term promise of
            job placement should be chosen. Government Arts College has been
            known for its quality education not only pertaining to academics but
            also overall personality development of the students.

            As globalization has reached the education sector, the college has
            geared up to grab new opportunities, and thus the Tamilnadu State
            Higher Education Council has entered into collaborations with
            universities in U.K. These collaborations enable the college to
            offer students programme in U.K. Universities. So far, many post
            graduate students have completed the post graduation programme under
            the foreign study programme. The college also offers a unique Degree
            course in Defence Studies. A student can pursue this Degree course
            during Shift II. This Degree course will be a great advantage to all
            students who aspire for uniformed services.
